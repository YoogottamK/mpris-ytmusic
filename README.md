# mpris integration for YouTube Music

This firefox extentsion provides access to YouTube music tracks via mpris.

### What does that mean?
Doing something and want to change the current track? Want to pause the song?

With this, you no longer need to open the tab. You can now directly use the buttons (or playerctl and similar controllers) to control playback.

### Other benefits
 - polybar integration (script and polybar config can be found in [my dotfiles](https://github.com/yoogottamk/dotfiles); will be integrated here soon)
